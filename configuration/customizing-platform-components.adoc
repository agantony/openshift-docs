{rh-rhacs-first} includes enhanced capabilities to classify violations and vulnerabilities into User Workload or Platform categories. Thus helping you focus on actionable data by segmenting issues based on who is responsible for addressing them.

User workloads refer to the applications and images you deploy and manage directly. Platform components include the underlying infrastructure, Operators, and third-party services. By categorizing security findings, {product-title-short} helps you maintain oversight while prioritizing fixes for issues they directly control.

{product-title-short} automatically identifies platform components based on predefined namespaces. Additionally, you can also customize which namespaces {product-title-short} identify as platform components. You can address platform issues by upgrading the offending component, such as {ocp} or third-party software, rather than requiring direct user remediation. Thus, by customizing platform components, you can focus on actionable security findings within your user workloads
