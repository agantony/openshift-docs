You can use {product-title-short} to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from scanned container images.

:FeatureName: Generation of SBOMs from the scanned container images
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

SBOMs give you a detailed overview of software components, dependencies, and libraries within your application. {product-title-short} uses the results of scans performed by {product-title-short} to generate an SBOM. You can generate an SBOM by using the {product-title-short} portal, the `roxctl` CLI, or the {product-title-short} API.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title-short} cannot generate SBOMs from results of delegated scans. In delegated scanning, you are using your secured cluster to index images and sending data to Central for vulnerability matching. SBOM generation is only available when using Scanner V4 configured in Central.
