= Understanding platform components

{product-title-short} automatically identify platform components by built-in definitions. However, with {product-title-short} 4.8 and newer, you can view and customize these definitions, providing more granular control over how {product-title-short} categorizes security findings.

When viewing violations and vulnerabilities in RHACS, they are categorized as either **User workloads** or **Platform**. This distinction helps you understand the scope and responsibility for addressing security findings.

**User workloads** include violations and vulnerabilities that affect the applications and images you deploy and manage in your system.

**Platform** includes violations and vulnerabilities related to the platform itself, such as those in workloads and images deployed by {ocp} and layered services. Platform components are currently defined using entire namespaces, and RHACS uses regular expression patterns to specify such namespaces.

You can view the platform components definition in the {product-title-short} portal by going to **Platform Configuration** > **System Configuration**.

The **Platform components configuration** section lists platform components in the following categories:

* **Core system components**: These components are part of the core {ocp} and Kubernetes namespaces. {product-title-short} includes them in the platform definition by default. You cannot customize these definitions. These definitions might change when you upgrade the system.
* **Red{nbsp}Hat layered products**: Components found in Red{nbsp}Hat layered and partner product namespaces are included in the platform definition by default. You must update the definition if you install Red{nbsp}Hat products, including {product-title-short}, into a non-default namespace.
* **Custom components**: You can extend the platform definition by defining namespaces for additional applications and products. You can use it to classify other namespaces as **Platform**, such as third-party applications, to exclude them from the focused **User workloads** views.
