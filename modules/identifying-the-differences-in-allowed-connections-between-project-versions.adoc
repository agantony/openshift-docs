= Identifying the differences in allowed connections between project versions

The `roxctl netpol connectivity diff` command identifies differences in allowed connections between two project versions. It analyzes network policy, Admin Network Policy (ANP), and Baseline Admin Network Policy (BANP) manifests in each version's directory. This analysis provides a text-based report of the differences. It also includes the impact of ANP and BANP resources, giving you a complete view of policy changes across cluster scopes.

You can view connectivity difference reports in a variety of output formats, including `text`, `md`, `dot`, and `csv`.
