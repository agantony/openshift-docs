= Modifying platform component definitions

You can define platform components by using namespaces to segment platform security findings from user workloads.

.Prerequisites
* You must have the `Administration` role with `read` permission to view the platform component configuration options.
* You must have the `Administration` role with `write` permission to modify the platform component configuration.

.Procedure

. In the RHACS portal, go to **Platform Configuration** > **System Configuration**.
. On the *System Configuration* view header, click **Edit**.
. Under the **Platform components configuration** section, click on the **Red{nbsp}Hat layered products** tab. Components found in Red{nbsp}Hat layered and partner product namespaces are included in the platform definition by default.
.. To modify the Red{nbsp}Hat layered products definition, enter one or more namespaces using regular expressions, separated by a pipe `|` symbol. For more information on the syntax structure, see the link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/syntax[RE2 syntax reference].
. Click on the **Custom components** tab.
.. To add a custom platform component, click **Add custom platform component**. You can add more than one.
.. In the new **Custom component** entry, enter a descriptive **Name**.
.. Enter the **Namespace rules (Regex)** for this custom component. Enter one or more namespaces using regular expressions, separated by a pipe `|` symbol. For more information on the syntax structure, see the link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/syntax[RE2 syntax reference].
