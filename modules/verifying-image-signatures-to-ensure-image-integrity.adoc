= Verifying image signatures to ensure image integrity

To verify image integrity, you must check that a trusted source signed the image.
If you have enabled transparency log validation for your signature integration, you must also confirm that the scan includes a valid transparency log bundle. 

For multi-architecture images, you must sign both the index and architecture-specific digests to avoid runtime resolution issues.

.Prerequisites

* You have created a signature integration.
+
For more information about how to create a signature integration, see "Securing container Images by using signature integration". 

.Procedure

* To scan an image signature by using the `roxctl` CLI, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl image scan \
--image=<registry>/<repository>/<image>@<digest> \
--force-insecure-skip-tls-verify
----
+
where:
+
--
`<registry>`:: Specifies the container image registry. For example, `quay.io`.
`<repository>`:: Specifies the repository of the container image. For example, `quay`.
`<image>`:: Specifies the name of the container image that you want to scan. For example, `busybox`.
`<digest>`:: Specifies the digest of the container image. For example, `sha256:92f3298bf80a1ba949140d77987f5de081f010337880cd771f7e7fc928f8c74d`.
--
+
Verify that the output includes the signature. 
If transparency log validation is enabled for your signature integration, verify that the output includes the Rekor bundle with the proof of inclusion into the transparency log. 
+
If certificate verification is enabled for your signature integration, verify that the output includes the certificate verification data.
