= Configuration using DevOps

You can use {product-title-short} with your DevOps system to configure authentication and authorization resources, including the following examples:

* Authentication providers
* Roles
* Permission sets
* Notifiers
* Access scopes

To use DevOps to configure these parameters, you create YAML files that contain configuration information. These files are used to create a config map that is added to {product-title-short} by using a mount point during installation of the {product-title-short} Central resource.

Additionally, you can use your DevOps system to configure and manage security policies by using the "policy as code" feature. You can author policies in YAML or JSON and save them as Kubernetes custom resources (CRs). Then, you use your DevOps system to track, manage, and apply policies to your clusters that are running {product-title-short}. A Kubernetes controller in {product-title-short} uses the API to receive information about new, updated, or deleted policies and reconciles the policy changes.
