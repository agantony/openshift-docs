= Retrieving explanations

[role="_abstract"]
You can understand why connections are allowed or denied based on your Kubernetes network policy rules by retrieving the explanations.

.Procedure

* To generate a connectivity report with explanations, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ roxctl netpol connectivity map --explain <folder_path> <1>
----
+
<1> Specify the path to the folder, which can include sub-folders that contain YAML resources and network policies for analysis.

When you use the `--explain` flag, the connectivity report includes an *explanation section* that details the specific policies and rules relevant to each allowed or blocked connection.
