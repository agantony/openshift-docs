= Connectivity mapping using the roxctl netpol connectivity map command

Connectivity mapping shows you allowed connections between workloads. It uses network policies defined in Kubernetes manifests, including Admin Network Policy (ANP) and Baseline Admin Network Policy (BANP). You can visualize and understand how your Kubernetes workloads communicate based on these combined network policies.

To retrieve connectivity mapping information, the `roxctl netpol connectivity map` command requires a directory path. This directory must contain your Kubernetes network policy, ANP, and BANP manifests. The command's output details the connectivity within the analyzed Kubernetes resources.
