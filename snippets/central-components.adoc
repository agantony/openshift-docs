* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles API interactions and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-short} and handles all data persistence. It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanner V4*: Beginning with version 4.4, {product-title-short} contains the Scanner V4 vulnerability scanner for scanning container images. Scanner V4 is built on link:https://github.com/quay/claircore[Claircore], which also powers the link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair] scanner. Scanner V4 supports language and OS-specific image components, node, and platform scanning. Scanner V4 contains the Indexer, Matcher, and DB components.
** *Scanner V4 Indexer*: The Scanner V4 Indexer performs image indexing, previously known as image analysis. Given an image and registry credentials, the Indexer pulls the image from the registry, finds the base operating system, if it exists, and looks for packages. The Indexer then stores and outputs an index report, which contains the findings for the given image.
** *Scanner V4 Matcher*: The Scanner V4 Matcher performs vulnerability matching. If the Indexer that is installed in Central indexed the image, then the Matcher fetches the index report from the Indexer and matches the report with the vulnerabilities stored in the Scanner V4 database. If the Indexer that is installed in a Secured Cluster performed the indexing, then the Matcher uses the index report that was sent from that Indexer, and then matches against vulnerabilities. The Matcher also fetches vulnerability data and updates the Scanner V4 database with the latest vulnerability data. The Scanner V4 Matcher outputs a vulnerability report, which contains the final results of an image.
** *Scanner V4 DB*: This database stores information for Scanner V4, including all vulnerability data and index reports. A persistent volume claim (PVC) is required for Scanner V4 DB on the cluster where Central is installed.
* *StackRox Scanner*: The StackRox Scanner originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner and was the default scanner for {product-title-short} before Scanner V4.
//If we are deprecating, this would be announced in release notes.
* *Scanner-DB*: This database contains data for the StackRox Scanner.

The {product-title-short} scanner analyzes each image layer to determine the base operating system and identify programming language packages and packages that were installed by the operating system package manager. It matches the findings against known vulnerabilities from various vulnerability sources. In addition, it identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and platform.
