When you install {product-title-short} on {ocp} by using the {product-title-short} Operator, or on {ocp} or any supported Kubernetes system by using Helm with the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart, {product-title-short} installs the StackRox Scanner and Scanner V4 components on every secured cluster. This enables the scanning of images in the integrated OpenShift image registry or in any registry that {product-title-short} integrates with when delegated scanning is enabled. You can choose to not install the StackRox Scanner or Scanner V4 on the secured clusters and install them only on the cluster where Central is installed. For more information, see "Enabling Scanner V4".
