You can install {product-title-short} on your secured clusters by using one of the following methods:

* Install by using the Operator
* Install by using Helm charts
* Install by using the `roxctl` CLI (do not use this method unless you have a specific installation need that requires using it)

[id="installing-sc-operator"]
== Installing {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using the Operator

To install {product-title-short} by using the Operator, you first install the Operator and then use it to install {product-title-short} on the secured cluster.

[id="installing-sc-helm"]
== Installing {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using Helm charts

You can install {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using Helm charts with no customization, using the default values, or with customizations of configuration parameters.

[id="configure-secured-cluster-services-helm-chart-customizations"]
=== Configuring the secured-cluster-services Helm chart with customizations

This section describes Helm chart configuration parameters that you can use with the `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands.
You can specify these parameters by using the `--set` option or by creating YAML configuration files.

Create the following files for configuring the Helm chart for installing {product-title}:

* Public configuration file `values-public.yaml`: Use this file to save all non-sensitive configuration options.
* Private configuration file `values-private.yaml`: Use this file to save all sensitive configuration options. Ensure that you store this file securely.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While using the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart, do not modify the `values.yaml` file that is part of the chart.

[id="installing-sc-roxctl"]
== Installing {product-title-short} on secured clusters by using the roxctl CLI

This method is also referred to as the manifest installation method.

.Prerequisites

* If you plan to use the `roxctl` CLI command to generate the files used by the sensor installation script, you have installed the `roxctl` CLI.
* You have generated the files that will be used by the sensor installation script.

.Procedure

* On the {ocp} secured cluster, deploy the Sensor component by running the sensor installation script.
